## RapidAPI
I chose the Anime DB API from RapidAPI because it provides a comprehensive database of anime titles, including key details like title, image, ranking, number of episodes, and status. This API is easy to integrate with Android apps using Retrofit and OkHttp, and it returns structured JSON data that can be mapped directly to Kotlin models.

## Relevance to Users

A mobile app using this API is highly relevant to anime fans and casual viewers alike. Users can:

Search for their favorite anime by title.

Browse popular or highly ranked anime, complete with images and basic info.

Quickly view essential details such as number of episodes, type, and airing status.

This makes the app both informative and interactive, allowing users to discover new anime, track shows they are interested in, and access a rich database from a mobile-friendly interface. The API ensures that the data is up-to-date, which is crucial for anime enthusiasts who want accurate information about current and past series.
